# project
creativity of a beginner
my latest project "Bomb rush" - a 2-player interactive game built with Tkinter using python
Players take turns pressing grid buttons to reveal hearts or bombs, racing to fill their points bar first.
From experimenting with basic GUI elements to creating a fully functional game, this project was a blast!
